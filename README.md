# hi

A dead simple chat server and client without any external dependencies.

The UI is inspired by material design, but comes without framework bloat.
The entire page is about 19kb in size, without any minification.

The server is written in Go and pretty fast. Also, it's dead-simple.

There are probably bugs.
